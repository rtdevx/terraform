This series draws heavily from **Kalyan Reddy Daida**’s [Terraform on AWS with SRE & IaC DevOps](https://www.udemy.com/course/terraform-on-aws-with-sre-iac-devops-real-world-demos/) course on _Udemy_.

[His content](https://www.udemy.com/user/kalyan-reddy-9/) was a game-changer in helping me understand Terraform.
