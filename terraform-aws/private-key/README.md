For the purpose of this demonstration, private key for the EC2 instances is being held here.

In a poduction-grade environment, keys would be held either in your pipeline management software's vault, AWS Secret Engine and / or HashiCorp Vault.

This code is simply following Terraform course. Vault may be integrated later.
